AnnUI is a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your web apps.

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Highly Customizable

AnnUI inherits shadcn/ui's design philosophy while retaining Radix UI's powerful declarative component design. This ensures our components maintain high customizability while providing an excellent development experience.

### 🚀 Great Developer Experience

Through declarative component APIs, developers can build interfaces more intuitively, reduce boilerplate code, and improve development efficiency. Based on Radix UI's accessibility support, our components are inherently accessible.

### 🎭 Beautiful Animations

We've enhanced many components with animations to improve user experience and create more engaging, dynamic interfaces. These thoughtfully designed animations help provide visual feedback and make interactions more intuitive and delightful.
